        <h1>Introduction to Java</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Java, is a powerful yet simple High-Level programming language. It is a language that allows its users to build powerful codes that could be used to perform tasks varying from simple calculations to creating complex websites and applications. It is a great start for beginners who are looking forward to diving into the field of computer sciences and are searching for their first step towards it. Besides its simplicity, Java offers numerous tools that help developers save their time and energy by offering various built-in features which we'll discuss later in this blog.
        </p>
        <h2>History and Development</h2>
        <p>
            Java was developed by the Sun Microsystems headed by James Gosling in the year 1991 and it was initially named 'Oak'. The name 'Oak' was however discarded as it was taken by some other language that arrived before this language and so finally later on the name 'Java' came into existence. The languages used in the world before Java such as C or C++ were sufficient but however there was a lot of load on the programmer due to the complexity of these languages. This complexity not only reduced the productivity of these languages but also required more time. Moreover, error detection and error fixing was very difficult making the programmers look forward to a language that could solve these problems. Initially, Java was designed just to create internet applets that run on web browsers but due to its advanced features and simplicity it soon became popular and was then used as a programming language that was accepted worldwide.
        </p>
        <h2>Features of Java</h2>
        <p>
            Java offers various features that help its users to minimize their workload, save time, and give efficient results desired by the programmers. A few of the features offered by Java are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language (OOP).</li>
            <li>Java is a platform-independent programming language i.e. unlike earlier languages that operated only on the system they were written on, it could run on any system that had Java installed.</li>
            <li>It is a WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) programming language.</li>
            <li>It is a multithreaded language.</li>
            <li>Java is case sensitive i.e. Uppercase and Lowercase letters are treated differently.</li>
            <li>Being an OOP language, the code is written within a class and all the variables, methods/functions, comments, and all the related elements are contained in this class.</li>
            <li>Java can be used to create both Internet Applets that run on Web Browsers as well as Applications that can run on computers just like other programming languages.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Comments in Java</h2>
        <p>
            The comments are lines or pieces of text that are written in a program but are not executed by the Java compiler. The purpose behind writing comments is for the sake of understanding the code later on by the programmer or any other user. These comments can be written in two ways:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Single line comments:</strong> Only a single line can be written after using <code>//</code>.
                <br>For example: <code>//This is a sample single line comment</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Multi line comments:</strong> Here multiple lines or paragraphs can be written between <code>/* ... */</code>.
                <br>For example: <code>/*This is a sample<br>multi line comment*/</code>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tokens</h2>
        <p>
            The smallest or the fundamental unit of a program is called a token. It is every individual constituent that constitutes a program of Java. The tokens in Java are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Literals (Constants)</li>
            <li>Identifiers</li>
            <li>Punctuators</li>
            <li>Operators</li>
            <li>Separators</li>
        </ul>
